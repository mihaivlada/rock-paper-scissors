# HOW I MADE THE GAME
My first serious web project that I care about

I use basic html structure, basic css styling (without flexbox or grid);
In javascript I create a game knowledge, I select an element, I listen to a click event and create an element that writes an output to the screen based on the game knowledge

# HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
Click on the buttons on the screen and your output will apear
